You became an important part of my life and will always be a part of me, you made me feel what it feels like loving a person aside from my family with so much care and love. Having you with me feels so special because some might say that we can\'t be together in terms of gender which is not much totally accepted by many people. Then we both agreed to stay in this relationship, especially choosing me. I won\'t ask for more, as long as i love you and you loved me back. We\'ve reached to the point in life that we will pursue out different path, i promise that i will always be there supporting you until you reach the top. I\'m your number one fan of Cerillo Jersey #2, I love you so much despite of flaws and insecurities you have. You will always have me, as a friend, fan, lover and a family. I\'m still waiting "sa imong puhon" until you\'re ready na without pressure I\'ll wait love as long as its still you that I\'m waiting. I didn\'t regret meeting and loving you, you made me happy through pain and suffering. Thank you so much erl for everything without even knowing you grow a lot of space in me. I love you so much. \n' +
